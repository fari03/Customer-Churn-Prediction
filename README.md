# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to address the challenge of customer churn in the highly competitive telecom industry, where companies typically face an annual churn rate of 15-25%. By developing a predictive model to identify high-risk customers, we aim to implement targeted retention strategies, reduce churn, and foster business growth. The project utilizes advanced data analytics techniques to gain a holistic view of customer interactions across various channels.

## Significance
Reducing customer churn is crucial due to the cost-effectiveness of retaining existing customers compared to acquiring new ones. Effective churn mitigation preserves market position and creates opportunities for growth. This project underscores the importance of a data-driven approach in predicting and mitigating customer churn, highlighting the need for expanding coverage and enhancing customer loyalty to succeed in a competitive market.
